# Virtual Universe full stack application

Zoom wasn't built for online learning; but it's the most used meeting platform for the 1.3 billion children learning online. According to The United States Census Bureau in 2020, 63% of students felt the quality of online learning was worse than classroom learning.

**Thatâ€™s where Virtual Universe comes in.**

It's designed to bridge the gap between the screen and the virtual classroom by making it easier to communicate with and get support from your tutors.

## ðŸ˜Ž How did I do it? ðŸ˜Ž

I will combine MERN Stack which stands for: MongoDB, Express, React, Node with WebRTC and SocketIO for realtime communication possibility.

## ðŸ‘¾ Who else would use it? ðŸ‘½

By 2025, the online education market is projected to be worth around \$325 billion! (Chernev, 2021) <br/>
Our main audience is students, teachers, and tutors, but Vroom doesn't stop there - here are some other ways Vroom can assist:<br />
1 . Conducting votes on agenda items or motions in business meetings anonymously - over 40% of Fortune 500 companies use it to train their staff (Chernev, 2021) <br />
2 . Tracking progress on tasks in meetings <br />
3 . Helping cross-cultural teams achieve more with the in-chat translation feature <br />
